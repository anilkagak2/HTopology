Questions to be answered?
1) Who'll be the source node? How we'll distinguish it from others?
2) When do we assume the overlay is stabilized?
3) What is to be done, when joinOverlay() is called?
4) Need some timers for simulating the events, what all timers are required?
5) What different events are required?
	-> source generates packets a particular rate.
	-> each node receives packet from neighbours & distribute the packet to children
	-> Join the overlay
	-> Keep track of deadlines & schedule in case a packet is approaching the deadline
		- ImmediatePacketTime => if the deadline lies within this time of current time,
			then schedule to get it asap
			[WILL IT BE PRACTICAL? MAY BE ALL SEGMENTS ARE SCHEDULED?]
	-> Leave the overlay
	-> Notify failed node / continuous ping or keep track of liveliness of a node
