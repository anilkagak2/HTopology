OverSim - A Flexible Overlay Network Simulation Framework

OverSim is an open-source overlay network simulation framework for the
OMNeT++/OMNEST simulation environment. The simulator contains several
models for structured (e.g. Chord) and unstructured (e.g. GIA)
peer-to-peer protocols. OverSim is developed at the
Karlsruhe Institut of Technology (KIT), Institute of Telematics.

Please look into the doc/ subdirectory where you'll find installation
instructions, the license and the API documentation.

Disclaimer: OverSim is continuously being improved: new parts
are added, bugs are corrected, and so on. We cannot assert that any protocol
implemented here will work fully according to the specifications. YOU ARE
RESPONSIBLE YOURSELF TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MODELS YOU USE IN YOUR SIMULATIONS
WORK CORRECTLY, AND YOU'RE GETTING VALID RESULTS.
